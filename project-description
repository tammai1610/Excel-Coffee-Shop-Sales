☕️ Coffee Shop Analysis with Excel — Data Visualization Project 

📈 Data: Coffee Shop Sales from Maven’s Data Playground.

🧐 Purpose: Using advanced Excel formulas, PivotTables, and dynamic dashboards, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of coffee sales data for three Maven Roasters locations — Lower Manhattan, Hell's Kitchen, and Astoria. 
This analysis aimed to understand customer purchase behavior, streamline operations, and identify trends and opportunities for the business.

💯 Metrics:
- Sales and Revenue: Total Revenue per Month, Top Products per Revenue. 
- Popular Purchase Times: Transactions by Day of Week, Transactions by Hour of Day.
- Top 15 Products by Transactions and Revenue: Ranking Based on Transaction Volume and Revenue.

𝌣 Insights & Recommendations:
💡 Revenue: 
  All three stores experienced a growth in revenue, with the highest increase observed at the Hell’s Kitchen location in June, reaching a notable $56,957. 
  Each store achieved a revenue growth exceeding $25,000 during the initial six months of the year.

💡 Popular Purchase Times:
  Customers consistently purchased coffee on weekdays across all three stores. 
  The Lower Manhattan Store recorded the highest transactions on Monday with a significant +7150, while Hell’s Kitchen saw peak transactions on Tuesday and Friday, each with +7500 transactions. Additionally, Astoria reported +7300 transactions on Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.
  Astoria demonstrated the most consistent transaction patterns throughout the week among the three stores. There is a need for Lower Manhattan to analyze why Monday attracts a large number of customers compared to the rest of the week.

💡 Popular Purchase Times: 
  The peak customer hour across all three stores occurs between 7–10 am. 
  However, from 7–8 pm, both Hell’s Kitchen and Lower Manhattan experience a sharp decline in sales. 
  Continuing operations during these hours may result in potential financial losses.

💡 Popular Products:
  The most popular selections among customers were coffee, tea, and bakery items. 
  To enhance the sales of these products further, we can suggest promotional offers and introduce new or seasonal coffee and tea beverages.

💡 Highest Revenue Generated Product:
  Despite ranking third in the number of transactions, Barista Expresso generated the highest revenue ($91,406). 
  Exploring strategies to promote these products further could lead to substantial revenue growth.
